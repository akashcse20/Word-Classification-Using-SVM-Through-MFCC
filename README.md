# Word-Classification-Using-SVM-Through-MFCC
This project focuses on classifying spoken words using Support Vector Machines (SVM) based on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features. The process involves converting speech signals into spectrograms, extracting MFCC features, and using SVM for classification.
