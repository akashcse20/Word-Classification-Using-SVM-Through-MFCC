# Word Classification Using SVM through MFCC

üìÑ Project Overview
This repository demonstrates word classification from speech data using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The primary goal is to extract features from speech audio files, train an SVM classifier, and evaluate its performance for recognizing words.

## üìÇ Dataset Structure

The dataset contains **MFCC** files organized by class (word). The directory structure is:
```
/content/drive/MyDrive/project_17_18/MFCC_Dataset
```

## üìä Data Processing

### Loading MFCC Files
The `.MFC` files are loaded and parsed for each word class:
```python
data = []
labels = []

for class_folder in os.listdir(dataset_dir):
    class_folder_path = os.path.join(dataset_dir, class_folder)
    for file_name in os.listdir(class_folder_path):
        if file_name.endswith('.MFC'):
            with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                data_values = [float(line.strip()) for line in file.readlines()[1:]]
                data.append(data_values)
                labels.append(class_folder)
```

## üß† Model Training & Evaluation

### Splitting Data
Split the dataset into training and testing sets:
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### SVM Model Training
Train the **SVM classifier** with a linear kernel:
```python
svm_classifier = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0)
svm_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Performance Evaluation
Evaluate the model‚Äôs **accuracy**:
```python
y_pred = svm_classifier.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

#### Confusion Matrix
Visualize the classification performance using a confusion matrix:

## üíæ Saving the Model
Save the trained model for future use:
```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(svm_classifier, '/content/drive/MyDrive/project_17_18/svm_model.pkl')
```

## üìà Evaluation Metrics
Performance metrics include:
- **Accuracy**: The overall correct predictions.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions.
- **Recall**: How well the model captures positive instances.
- **Loss**: Calculated as `1 - accuracy`.

### Example Output:
```plaintext
Accuracy: 95.67%
Precision: 94.50%
Recall: 96.30%
Loss: 4.33%
```

- **Data Augmentation**: Implement noise addition, pitch shifting, and more to diversify the dataset.
- **Expanded Dataset**: Add more words and increase the dataset for better generalization.
